# Google-Capstone-Project

Hi My Name is Ronnie Boyd, and Welcome to my first Analytics project. I recently became certified through **Googles Analytical Program.** After the completion of the course I was given two case studes to choose from to showcase all the skills I learned. By using steps on the analysis process; asking questions, collecting, processing, analyzing, and creating vizuals of data. I was able to complete my first project.  This Project is based around a Bike-Share company in Chicago.

<br>

<br>
Recommendations
<br>
<br>
1. Incentivise to casual members that if their avg ride duration is 25 minutes or longer throughout the course of the month they can get bonuses and discounts! Ex: Free rides for Friends.
<br>
<br>
2. Create a summer pass package that casual customers can purcahse. Majority of rides taken by causal riders are in the summer.
<br>
<br>
3. Create a subsription tier system where an option is weekends only. This could intrigue casual riders to commit to a subscription.
<br>
<br>
4. For better analysis begin tracking demographic data such as, sex and age. This will provide better marketing strategies, and better knowledge on who to focus promotional spending on.
