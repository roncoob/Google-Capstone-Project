# Google-Capstone-Project

Hi My Name is Ronnie Boyd, and Welcome to my first Analytics project. I recently became certified through **Googles Analytical Program.** After the completion of the course I was given two case studes to choose from to showcase all the skills I learned. By using the six steps of analysis; asking questions, collecting, processing, analyzing, and creating vizuals of data. By doing so I was able to complete my first project.  The Project is based around a Bike-Share company in Chicago.
